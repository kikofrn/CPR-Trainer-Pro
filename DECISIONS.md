# Decisions

## 2026-07-26
- Bucket is source of truth enforced at build time, not runtime.
- Update detection is etag based via a Cloudflare Worker manifest endpoint at `/api/manifest`.
- Update triggered downloads use version pinned URLs to defeat CDN cache staleness.
- Course structure remains hardcoded in `chapters.ts` and is never replaced at runtime.
- Thumbnails refresh silently without a user prompt.
- The pediatric slideshow courses are live and only the two pediatric Virtual Assistant courses are coming soon.
- This release is Windows only with macOS and iOS ported afterward.
- Plan documents live in `docs/plans/` and sessions stop rather than search outside the repository.
- No anticipatory code, state, or scaffolding; no probes or verification beyond phase scope.
- The Worker manifest endpoint is live at `https://media.ehacademy.com/api/manifest` on the preferred Workers route.
- `desktop.ini` was removed from both pediatric presentation folders.
- Reconciliation and verification skip content flagged `isComingSoon`.
- Every phase ends with a commit named for the phase before the verification report.
- Temporary files must be listed in reports and deleted before phase end.
- Direction 2 scans only folders referenced by active courses and reports uncovered folders informationally.
- The update check flow is implemented as a pure module in `src/update-checker.ts`, cleanly separating the diffing logic from side effects.
- `src/snapshot-store.ts` handles JSON read/write queues for `.content-versions.json` natively, preventing race conditions between the update checker and download manager.
- Exponential decay for `avgSpeedBps` uses a 0.8/0.2 split favoring the historical average to avoid drastic UI fluctuation.
- Files are always staged explicitly by name and `git add -A` is prohibited.
- The update checker accepts the thumbnails registry as a function argument rather than importing a registry that does not exist until Phase 5.
